mq is a command-line tool that processes Markdown using a syntax similar to jq.
It's written in Rust, allowing you to easily slice, filter, map, and transform structured data.

## Why mq?

mq makes working with Markdown files as easy as jq makes working with JSON. It's especially useful for:

- **LLM Workflows**: Efficiently manipulate and process Markdown used in LLM prompts and outputs
- **Documentation Management**: Extract, transform, and organize content across multiple documentation files
- **Content Analysis**: Quickly extract specific sections or patterns from Markdown documents
- **Batch Processing**: Apply consistent transformations across multiple Markdown files

## Features

- **Slice and Filter**: Extract specific parts of your Markdown documents with ease.
- **Map and Transform**: Apply transformations to your Markdown content.
- **Command-line Interface**: Simple and intuitive CLI for quick operations.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable with custom functions.
- **Built-in support**: Filter and transform content with many built-in functions and selectors.
- **REPL Support**: Interactive command-line REPL for testing and experimenting.
- **IDE Support**: VSCode Extension and Language Server Protocol (LSP) support for custom function development.
