# Environment variables

Environment variables can be referenced using $XXX syntax, where XXX represents the name of the environment variable. For example:

- `$PATH` - References the PATH environment variable
- `$HOME` - References the HOME environment variable
- `$USER` - References the current user's username

This syntax is commonly used in shell scripts and configuration files to access system-level environment variables.
